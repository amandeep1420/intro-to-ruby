1.

"John" + " Doe"

#correct - the book just put an extra space after the first name.

2.

1,234

1234 / 1000 = 1
1234 % 1000 / 100 = 2
1234 % 1000 % 100 / 10 = 3
1234 % 1000 % 100 % 10 = 4

#correct - I distinctly remember being unable to answer this when we started the book.
#book shortcut pasted below:

#Note that for the tens and ones, you can skip the extra % operations like this:

tens = 1234 % 100 / 10
ones = 1234 % 10

movies = {
  :bum => 1975,
  :cat => 2004,
  :dog => 2013,
  :bird => 2001,
  "steve" => 1981
}

~or~

movies2 = { cat: 1975, dog: 2004, bird: 2013, egg: 2001, milk: 1981 }

#I know they want us to write every individual key out to call the value...

movies[:bum]
movies[:cat]
movies[:dog]
movies[:bird]
movies["steve"]

#I forgot to write puts, lol. Correct.

arr = [1975, 2004, 2013, 2001, 1981]

puts arr[0]
puts arr[1]
puts arr[2]
puts arr[3]
puts arr[4]

#correct.

#I still think this question is totally worthless..next time, let's try writing a program that'll output the factorial for any number
#in fact..
#why don't we do that now?

#...maybe we'll hold off for now.

5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
etc etc etc

#moving on...

6.

#this one is also pointless - I recall the solution just being x * x, not even x**2

#yep, correct.

7.

used a ) instead of a }

#basically.
