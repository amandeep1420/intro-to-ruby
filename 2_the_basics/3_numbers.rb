#Numbers can be represented in a variety of ways in Ruby...
#...but the most basic/common form is an "integer". Integers are whole numbers only - no decimal point.

#ex. 4, 5, 6, 7, 32947239

#A more complex form of a number is a "float". A float is a number that contains a decimal.

#ex. 2.3, 6.3, 7.2564
