#Puts and return are different.
#First, regarding expressions: they always DO something and RETURN something.
#All puts does is DO something (print something to the screen) - however, it doesn't generate a value to return.
#Ex. from irb:

#puts "butt"
#butt
# => nil

#Notice how nil was returned.

#We will return to this later for a deeper discussion.
