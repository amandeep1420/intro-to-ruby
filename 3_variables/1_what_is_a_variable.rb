#Variables are used to store information that can then be referenced/manipulated in a computer program.
#They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name so everyone understands what's going on.

#Basically, think of a variable as a container that holds information. 
#Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory; this data can then be used in programs!
