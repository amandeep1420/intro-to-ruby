Quick note. 

In past versions of Ruby, you couldn't rely on hashes maintaing order. Ruby 1.9 changed this - hashes now maintain the order in which 
they are stored.

It's important to know this - if you're ever working with a version of Ruby older than 1.9, you can't rely on the hashes being in any specific order.

Word.
