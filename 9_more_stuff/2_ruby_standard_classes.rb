Oftentimes, you'll want to perform a specific operation when writing a program in Ruby.
Your first instinct may be to look up the algorithm or try to implement the operation on your own...
...depending on the complexity of the operations, Launch School would like to encourage you otherwise.

When you have a specific action you need to perform, look for it first among Ruby's standard calsses.
Using libraries like the "Math" module can help you solve problems more efficiently.

Let's say you wanted to find a way to calculate the square root of a number - Ruby's "Math" module has a method called sqrt that you can 
use right away. See below:

Math.sqrt(400)
=> 20.0
